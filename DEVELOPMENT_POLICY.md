# Development Policy

This document outlines the core principles and rules for the development of this project.

## ⚠️ Core Rule: No Unsolicited Aesthetic Changes (Unless Instructed)

The visual design, sizing, spacing, and animations of this project are the author's intentional choices.

- **Instructions Take Precedence**: I will change any aspect of the design (size, color, layout, etc.) if you explicitly request it.
- **Communication Language**: All descriptions, implementation plans, and walkthroughs must be in **Japanese**. Do NOT use English unless specifically requested or for technical terms that have no common Japanese equivalent.
- **Do NOT** change CSS properties related to aesthetics (width, height, margin, padding, colors, box-shadows, etc.) **unsolicited**.
- **Do NOT** "improve" or "refine" the design based on personal preference or "modern" standards.
- **Focus** only on fixing bugs, implementing requested features, and improving the underlying code structure (e.g., refactoring logic, updating selectors for compatibility).
- **Ask First**: If you believe an aesthetic change is necessary to fix a functional issue, propose the change and wait for approval.

## Structural Changes & Refactoring

- When refactoring (e.g., unifying DOM structures or selectors), ensure that the visual output remains identical to the original design.
- Always verify the visual state before and after any change to ensure no regression has occurred.

## Verification

- Always test changes in-browser to confirm that animations, interactions, and layouts match the author's original intent.
- Use screenshots to track any subtle visual shifts during refactoring.

## 🚫 デプロイの禁止

- **AI機能で勝手にデプロイすることを禁じます**：意図しない変更をそのままコミットしてデプロイしてしまうことを3回観測したためです。このプロジェクトのデプロイは許可なく行わないでください。
